## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to harness the power of machine learning to build a robust predictive model for disease diagnosis. By analyzing various health attributes, our aim is to accurately classify individuals into diseased or non-diseased categories. This model serves as a valuable tool for healthcare professionals, offering insights into early detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of diseases.

## Tools

To achieve our objective, we employ a range of powerful tools and techniques, including:

- Python programming language
- Machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- SMOTE for oversampling
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before diving into model building, we meticulously explore our dataset to gain crucial insights into the underlying patterns and relationships. This step involves:

- Data loading
- Summary statistics
- Descriptive statistics
- Analysis of target variables
- Feature correlation examination

---

## Data Loading

We load the dataset containing health attributes and disease status of individuals, preparing it for analysis and model development.

---

## Data Summary

A comprehensive summary of the dataset is provided, including key statistics and characteristics essential for understanding the data's nature.

---

## Descriptive Statistics

Detailed descriptive statistics are generated to shed light on various aspects of the dataset, aiding in feature selection and model building.

---

## Target Variable Analysis

An in-depth analysis of the target variable is conducted to understand its distribution and significance in the context of disease diagnosis.

---

## Feature Correlation

We explore the correlation between different features to identify potential relationships and dependencies that can influence the predictive modeling process.

---

## Oversampling using SMOTE

To address class imbalance issues, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied to create synthetic samples, ensuring a balanced representation of diseased and non-diseased individuals.

---

## Splitting the Data

The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, facilitating the evaluation of model performance on unseen data.

---

## Models

We implement and evaluate the following machine learning models for disease diagnosis:

- Logistic Regression (`accuracy: 72%`)
- Decision Tree       (`accuracy: 86%`)
- Random Forest       (`accuracy: 96%`)

Each model undergoes rigorous testing and validation to assess its predictive capabilities and suitability for real-world application.
